# Flood Inundation Mapper

Flood Inundation Mapping (FIM) is a real-time, operational tool that visually relates streamgage data and weather forecasts to flood risk for the primary purpose of public safety.
The mapper will be able to take in various data sources, such as soil data, rainfall data, and river flow data, to predict the extent of flooding in a given area.

# Implementation

Python and web development tools will be used to implement the Flood Inundation Mapper. To carry out activities like data processing, spatial analysis, and visualisation, the mapper will make use of a number of Python packages. Additionally, the mapper will employ web technologies to make it available to users online.

# Usage

Users of all skill levels will find it simple to use the Flood Inundation Mapper. The mapper will produce a flood inundation map when users input their location and the relevant data sources. The extent of the flooding in the area as well as the height of the floodwaters will be depicted on the map.

# NOTE:
This project is in progress. It is decided to be implemented on a Website and Android App as well.
